        <string name="help_message">"Fahrenheit :\nThe Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686–1736).It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit. Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower defining point, 0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt).Originally set at 90 °F, then " +
                "96 °F.\n\n Celsius:\nThe degree Celsius is the unit of temperature on the Celsius scale(originally known as the centigrade scale outside Sweden),one of 2 temperature scales used in the International System of Units (SI), alongside the Kelvin scale. The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale in 1742."
